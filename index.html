      <br/>
      <p class="padded">Agata is a technology-enthusiast mother who learned about the Thymio on Facebook. She decides to buy a robot for the birthday of her 8yo daughter, Michela. Agata wants Michela to learn about programming and robotics while having fun! 
The Thymio comes in a box with a set of activities and challenges, each activity is well described and can be solved with different languages: VPL3, Scratch or Python. Each activity has a QR-code linking to the cloud, from where the Thymio experience starts.

Agata switches on the Thymio and connects the Thymio to the computer (cable/dongle…). She opens the webpage linked to the chosen activity, the Thymio is recognised, and Agata can now click on the link to open the programming environment that she prefers. She choses VPL3 and Michela can now start programming!

Michela can save and restart the activity/challenge any time. When she's happy with the result, she check her solution on the cloud: she submits her program, which is compared with the official solution(s)—later displayed to Michela for her to learn about other ways of obtaining the same behaviour. 

Michela's solution is also compared with the ones of other users, and evaluated for performance and cleanliness. A hall of fame is generated and updated whit all new challenges that are solved.</p>

      <br/>
      <p class="padded">We are student group of 3 and have to make a collective task with 3 Thymio that have to communicate together. In first time we have to split the work and decide how is responsible of each part and agree on witch channel, type of message allow to make the task. We have all a computer and can use the language of programming between VPL or Aseba to communicate. 
We can use both communication mechanism of Thymio as local IR or trough wireless (Wifi). First we make our programming in our part and testing the basic behavior of each robot. Then we combine our work creating a group of robot using the interface so that we are sure message are switch to all the robot. Local IR protocol is easy to set up and robots exchange data in a simple mode using color in VPL, that are easy to get from the scripting aseba mode .
We can follow from our computers all steps of the task and monitoring what is happening.
Finally we can show our solution comparing with other team in a small competition.</p>

      <br/>
      <p class="padded">I am student in a communication software lecture. We have to learn smart object networking. We have for that different kind of Thymio that are connect through wifi. We see all robots inside the network as well we have access trough specif IP to smart sensors. We can easily filter the robot by name or number so that we found our robots and can make a sub network that are not interfering the other robot from other student. One time my network is set up I can program my robots using python or aseba in studio. I can see easily all variable inside robots and plot graph or set up a monitor panel that show me the status (like sysquake). 
So I make my smart scenario where when I come back home, the camera robot is recognising me and ask me if it is not to cold outside (it knows trough a smart temperature sensors). I respond that I am cold and need a coffee. Some action are generated on different module that easing me the life like opening doors or switching on lamps. A mobile Thymio 3 robot brings me a coffee.</p>

      <br/>
      <p class="padded">This user story is about a primary school teacher who should introduce computer science or artificial intelligence or computstional thinking in her class based on the goals defined in the curriculum. This story could be also the story of a teacher who would like to use educational robotics in his teaching. The first thing the teacher will looking at is training. Of course she would prefer a standard training by human trainers but any hybrid solution could also help. As this is a path supported by local universities and government, she goes on the thymio community platform looking for a course in her region. She finds hybrid courses where a human trainer helps her remotely. This help includes debug, clarification of the students' progress, analisis of the activities of the class, and thus remedy the difficulties encountered. For this the trainer has access to analytics of the class activity. The teacher follows the training by making activities together with other 2-3 teachers, meeting them outside school hours. To run this she gets the full equipment at home and she can interact remotely with a set up located at the trainer's place. The training is strongly centerd on the activities done by the kids that the teacher can experiment to understand the full concept. The activities combine unplugged activities and activities using pc or tablet, transversal (soft) skills and disciplinary ones. A library of activities is available and can be easily explored (videos show how this look like) and tested. The activities are relevant with the curriculum, radiate in the interdisciplinary fields calling for the creativity (and critical spirit) of students, to guide them in their daily actions with the machines that surround them. Every activity is explicitly connected to some concepts of the curriculum. The teacher is then invited to experiment the activities in her class, using the same environment used in her training and borrowing the thymio for the class from a local (or school based) educational center. The Thymio environment allows to manage the class, organise sequences of activities, modify the exercises, collect and format evaluations, keep logs pf activities and grades. It can be combined with other well-known environments such as graasp. When in the class, the children can also exchange with other classes and have common activities remotely, accessing a common infrastructure. The teacher can continuously exchange with colleagues about the experience, get and give suggestions. Results can be formatted to be sent online to the parents. If the teacher create new activities she can easily share them with colleagues.

In case of COVID situations, the teacher can access remotely to the environment of the children and interact with them using a video conferencing tool embedded in the system. She can also exploit shared Thymio infrastructures (distant places with Thymio robots accessible for class activities).</p>

      <br/>
      <p class="padded">GreenGames is an NGO that uses new technologies, including robots, to deliver serious games to promote sustainability and environmentally respectful lifestyles. The education department wants to setup a new interactive serious game to be delivered at fairs and science festivals, targeting children from 6 to 12 years old. They learned about Thymio and want to setup a game with a dozen robots working in parallel. They first experience with the simulator, and then decide to rent or buy the robots.
The main aspects of the demo are the interaction among robots through local communication, and the possibility of users to define the robot behaviour on the fly. 
 A child stepping by at the GreenGame stand should use a tablet to interact with one or more robots at the same time, and observe the effects of his interaction on the behaviour of the robots. Everything is designed to bring forth an educational message that is embodied by the robots' behaviour. 

Given the availability of a flexible API, GreenGames decides to develop a custom web frontend. The robots are provided with a set of basic behaviours, which are programmed using Python or VPL3, first with simulations (for evaluation purposes) and then with real robots. These behaviours represent the building blocks of the interactive game.
The custom frontend allows to define a high-level behaviour by dragging and dropping blocks to be executed concurrently, and allows to set some parameter for the building blocks. Once a user is satisfied with the solution, it can assign it to one or more robots available in the interactive game with just few clicks. The frontend enables multiple kids to work in parallel on different tablets, and the kids need to cooperate for the global mission to be accomplished. Only when all kids adhere to a “sustainable” solution, the robots will be capable of solving the challenge. In this way, by engaging with the robots and with each other, the children learn about sustainability and the need to collaborate.

The demonstration is made available online to other associations willing to deliver it in as many venues as possible. The Thymio rental service supports deployments even for single events..</p>

      <br/>
      <p class="padded">This user story is about a high-school computer science teacher who would like to use Thymio in her computer science courses to introduce artificial intelligence or computational thinking , of course aligned with the goals defined in the curriculum. This person has a master in computer science and does not need any training in this field, but needs good documentation and well-prepared activities. Therefore she looks on internet and find the Thymio repository and teacher community. She finds activities that are well aligned with the curriculum, and using the same language she is using (phython). She can modify the activities to match specific needs of the class (inclusion). The programming environment she can access allows simulation, use of a real robot, debug, remote access and is easy to install on the very different computers of the students (BYOD). To test she can get the full equipment at home and she can interact remotely with a set up located in a central place. The activities combine unplugged activities and activities using pc or tablet, CS core concepts and sociological aspects related to digital transformation. The teacher is then testing the activities in her class, getting thymio from central borrowing centers. The Thymio environment allows to manage the class, organise sequences of activities, modify the exercises, collect and format evaluations, keep logs of activities, do analytics on these logs and and manage grades. It can be combined with other well-known environments such as graasp. When in the class, the children can also exchange with other classes and have common activities remotely, accessing a common infrastructure. The teacher can continuously exchange with colleagues about the experience, get and give suggestions. Results can be formatted and published online. If the teacher create new activities she can easily share them with colleagues.

In case of COVID situations, the teacher can access remotely to the environment of the students and interact with them using a video conferencing tool embedded in the system. She can also exploit shared Thymio infrastructures (distant places with Thymio robots accessible for class activities).

      <h4 class="center"><i>#7: </i>Arianna in class</h4>
      
      <br/>
      <p class="padded">"Arianna is a researcher in social pedagogy that loves to use new technologies, especially robots, to create educational content that develops soft skills in children.
Starting from this purpose and exploiting a design pattern for collective decision-making in decentralized systems based on the honeybees behaviour, she would like to implement a demonstration for the Thymio robots, which also includes an interactive part for educational purposes. The case study focuses on a value-sensitive collective decision problem, whereby a group of Thymio robots need to choose the highest value option among a set of available alternatives. 

In her implementation, a group of 𝑁 = 8 house-hunting Thymios (dressed as bees, and called Thymio–Bees) are engaged in a collective decision among 𝑀 = 4 available options, that are embodied by an immobile Thymio–Nest, which is characterized by a quality value.
The Thymio–Nests are positioned at the corner of a square arena, that is, otherwise free for the Thymio–Bees to move and explore. 
A remote controller or a mobile APP are used to interact with the DEMO: turn on/off the run, set the Thymio–Bees attitude (collaborative vs. stubborn) and the quality of the Thymio-Nests. 

Arianna wrote her code using Aseba language and save the bytecode on a sd card to be ready to set-up the demonstration everywhere and in a quick way. She goes to show her activities on several schools, educational events and exhibitions and she usually is likely to use the rental service, when needed. The demonstration is made available online to other educators and schools to replicate it as many times as possible.

      <h4 class="center"><i>#8: </i>The end of the year Diorama</h4>
      
      <br/>
      <p class="padded">"A coding teacher would like to organise the annual year-end demonstration with her students. She selected the Thymio robots as robotic platform to implement an animated diorama. Students work in groups of 2 or 3 with one robot per group to prepare their part. The robots are used to animate the different characters or elements of the set. Moreover, some robots will be ""animated"" by children with special needs thanks to the integration with C.A.A. Sw. to guarantee inclusion.
The robots are synchronised with each other to perform a storytelling, using direct/local communication or through a central computer.
Thymio play different roles and to increase the audience engagement, some robots can interact by providing an easy way to record sounds and react to simple ""vocal commands"".

The diorama have to remain in position and running for several days, so the robots need to be easily replaced to recharge the batteries. The Demo can be stopped or re-started at any time by a single command (avoiding to switch the robots off one by one). Sd-cards are used to save pre-defined roles and to replace on the fly discharged or malfunctioning robots with other ones.
And afterwards, the teacher will create and share libraries of the behaviours as reausable resources to help grow the Community Databases with ready-made programs/components. ".</p>

      <h4 class="center"><i>#9: </i>Fantasy Story</h4>
      
      <br/>
      <p class="padded">"
A teacher at secondary level 1 decides to start a class project where he tries to integrate as many teaching subjects as possible, e.g. languages, mathematics, natural science, manual tasks, music etc.  to foster creativity and collaboration in his class. His goal is to involve all his pupils according to their talents. Therefore, he starts a special theatre project where his class must create and perform its own fantasy story. He animates the class to think about characters that could occur in this fantasy story. As a source he suggests historic characters (related to history lessons) or characters from exotic places (related to geography lessons) or fantasy creatures based and exotic animals or plants (related to biology lessons). The teacher's idea is to have a few human actors on stage as well as some artificial creatures made from cardboard, coloured paper and wood. The artificial creatures should be colourful light-weight objects that are controlled by Thymio3 Robots. The robots should use their wheels to make the objects move or use their LEDs to create colourful light effects. The loudspeakers could generate the necessary sound effects. 
The plan of the project is that the class first works out the different characters of the play, the human characters as well as the artificial fantasy creatures. For each of these different kinds of actors the teacher wants to have a short description and if possible, also a rough sketch. He lets his pupils work in small groups to create a set of characters. At this stage there is no special focus on the stories content. The class finally decides which of the characters they want to use to create their play. 
During the next stage the teacher splits the class in different teams. He needs writers, actors, designer for the stage and designers for the fantasy creatures as well as programmers that can integrate the robots that perform all the movement, sound and light effects. For one fantasy creatures it may be necessary to use more than one Robot. Pupils can use special wheels to wind up strings that are fixed to movable parts or they can fix lightweight objects directly to the wheels. In case they need to execute precise and reproduceable movements, the robot is equipped with a position feedback for each wheel. If several robots work in collaboration, they can be linked with an optical link in order to send trigger signals from one robot to another. The programming tool makes it convenient to deploy different programs to a set of robots. It's also important to think about how to activate the fantasy creatures' behaviours by means of the available sensors during the performance. The idea is that the fantasy creatures react as autonomous objects that can activated during the performance by the actors or by an assistant. It's helpful that the robots have proper fixation points that can be used to fix them tightly on a base construction made of wooden slats. While some of the pupils are working on a story around the defined human and nonhuman characters, others are constructing colourful objects with wings and arms and many other movable parts like big illuminated eyes with eyelids that can move up and down. There are even some small creatures that move like ducklings over the stage by following a predefined path marked with a black line and they coordinate their behaviour by IR communication. 
During the public performance where parents and relatives are present all pupils are involved either as actors or they are responsible for the proper operation of any of the fantasy creatures. 
After the performance there is a backstage presentation where the audience can have a closer look at all the fantasy creatures and their creators are there to explain how they were built and how they operate. 
The teacher is satisfied about his project as he realises that even pupils that were not prepared to perform on stage were enthusiastic to explain their work to the audience during the backstage presentation. What makes him specially happy is the fact that his pupils had to use so many different skills during the preparation: They had to find sources of inspiration, they had to weigh up different ways of constructions for their objects, they had to measure ,to estimate and to calculate, to describe behaviours, to coordinate speed and sequences of different movements and to express different behaviours in programs. They had to write a story, to draw, to speak in public and take over responsibilities for material and functions. His pupils also learnt how to work in a team and how inspiring it is to combine different ideas and skills to something that is bigger than one single idea or skill.

      <br/>
      <p class="padded">"Curiosity is palpable in the air: today we will finally work with a robot! I am sitting at my desk, in the front row. Usually the front row is not coveted, but today I'm glad to be so far ahead, I will be able to see the robots better! The bell rings and, finally, two boys enter the class with a steel-colored briefcase and bags containing computers. We are all sitting in place, eagerly waiting to begin. The boys introduce themselves, they say they are educators specialized in robotics: today they will give a lesson on cyberbullying! They open the steel case, and, inside, there are several white robots, with two black wheels. The boys present the robot: it's called Thymio, it's a small white robot, with two wheels and different sensors, which allow it to find obstacles and move around the room alone. Thymio has LEDs that change color; each color corresponds to a different behavior! I can't wait to try! The two educators make us divide into groups: luckily I'm with my best friend! Each group has a robot and a computer: they initially make us try the behaviors already present in Thymio, corresponding to the various colors. Then they make us turn on the computer and explain Thymio VPL, the program to program the robot! It is very simple and colorful! Our group has to program the bully. It is difficult for everyone to agree, but in the end we manage to write a beautiful program! The educators complimented us!
Here's how one of the children in the classes we work in would describe a discovery laboratory with Thymio. We never use a robot for every child, but we prefer shared use (at least one robot for every three children), we believe it is essential for collaborative learning and for going to work on relational skills. This allows us to work also on the inclusion of the most fragile children who receive support directly from their group mates in case of need, but who at the same time manage to put their particular skills into play at the service of the group and to achieve a common goal.
When we organize classroom workshops, teachers often ask us to characterize them according to the topic / subject that is being addressed at that particular time with the children. In some cases, this involves an initial planning done in collaboration with the teachers themselves, who thus feel more involved and responsible for the workshop they will participate in.".</p>

      <p class="padded">"
The idea is that a Teacher who supports a student with difficulties to learn (foreigner without a common language with the teacher or with Autism, Asperger, Down syndrom, or other problems where CAA could help) is helped by a teacher to use a robot like Thymio to learn. The techer writes the PECS withS SIMCAA. In SIMCAA there are the icons for Thymio and common words (I am working on that) and the VPL icons. Then there should be a sort of integration of shared instructions between Thymio programming IDE and SIMCAA to make life easy for the teachers and a smooth UX.

""We are finally at the Expo! It's been a long time since I came here, it's really changed a lot! Today I will have a laboratory with a small robot, with a somewhat strange name: Thymio. I am really curious! With me is my little sister; she's small, but she's eager to try the lab too! We enter Cascina Triulza and go up the stairs: we are welcomed by nice guys, all dressed in a black T-shirt. They make us sit in a circle, my little sister next to me. They give each of us a Thymio and leave us a few minutes to discover the robot: in his hand it is very nice; looks like a little monster with many eyes! If you press the upper keys it turns on! If I press the triangular arrows it changes color, while if I press the central circle it moves! The guys with the black T-shirt, at one point, explain to us how the robot works. They say he is able to feel emotions! I look at them amazed: they make us wear the robot with the red color; they tell us to observe it carefully. Anger immediately comes to mind; however, observing him carefully, I see that if I approach him with my hand he runs away, as if he were frightened! Then I raise my hand and say ""Thymio is afraid!"". It was correct! After the red color, they also make us try all the other behaviors! It was a great workshop!""
The exploratory laboratory is the basis of all our events at the Stripes Digitus Lab as they help us understand the basic level at which children start and give them initial training in the use of a tool they have most likely never seen before. The basic behaviors are very useful for making educational workshops that have emotions as their main theme, children can easily project their emotions onto a tool other than them and thus be able to better process the most unpleasant emotions such as anger and fear.".</p>
